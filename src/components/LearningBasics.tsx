      <h2>Farming Basics</h2>

      <p>
        Farming is a system, not a single activity. It depends on multiple
        factors working together in balance.
      </p>

      <p>
        Every farming decision is influenced by four core elements:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Soil:</strong> Type, fertility, and health of the land</li>
        <li><strong>Water:</strong> Rainfall, irrigation, and availability</li>
        <li><strong>Season:</strong> Climate and timing of crops</li>
        <li><strong>Crop:</strong> What you grow and why</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Successful farming comes from understanding how these elements interact
        — not from using more chemicals or expensive tools.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once you understand the basics, choosing crops and methods becomes
        simpler and more logical.
