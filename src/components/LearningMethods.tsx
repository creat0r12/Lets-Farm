      <h2>Farming Methods</h2>

      <p>
        Farming methods describe how crops are grown and how soil is managed.
        Different methods have different impacts on soil health, cost, yield,
        and long-term sustainability.
      </p>

      <h4>Main farming methods:</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Organic Farming:</strong> Uses natural inputs, improves soil
          health, and focuses on long-term sustainability.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Inorganic (Chemical) Farming:</strong> Uses synthetic
          fertilizers and pesticides for faster results but needs careful
          management.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Mixed Farming:</strong> Combines crops, livestock, and
          different practices for balance.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        For beginners, starting with organic or low-chemical methods is often
        safer and more sustainable.
