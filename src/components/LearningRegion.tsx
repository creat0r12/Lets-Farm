      <h2>For Your Region</h2>

      <p>
        Farming practices change from region to region. Soil type, climate,
        rainfall, and seasons vary across India.
      </p>

      <p>
        A crop or method that works well in one state may fail in another.
        That is why location-based guidance is important.
      </p>

      <p>
        We are building region-specific learning that will guide you based on
        your state, local climate, and soil conditions.
