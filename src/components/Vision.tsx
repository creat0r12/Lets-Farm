      <h2>Our Vision</h2>

      <p>
        We envision a future where farming is respected, sustainable, and
        attractive to the next generation. A future where agriculture works in
        harmony with nature, not against it.
      </p>

      <p>
        By promoting organic practices, clear guidance, and modern tools, we aim
        to help farmers and youth make confident decisions — from soil care to
        crop selection and long-term sustainability.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the future, this platform will evolve to provide smart assistance
        through technology, market awareness, and on-ground support — ensuring
        farming remains meaningful and future-ready.
