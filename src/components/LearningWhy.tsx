      <h2>Why Learn Farming?</h2>

      <p>
        Farming is not just about growing crops. It is about understanding
        nature, food systems, and making decisions that affect health,
        environment, and livelihoods.
      </p>

      <p>
        Today, many people depend on farming but very few understand how it
        actually works. This gap creates confusion, losses, and fear around
        agriculture.
      </p>

      <p>
        Learning farming gives you clarity. It helps you understand soil,
        seasons, crops, and methods — so you can make informed choices instead
        of guessing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether you want to farm full-time, part-time, or simply understand
        where your food comes from, learning the basics of farming is valuable
        for everyone.
