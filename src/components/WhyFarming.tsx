      <h2>Why Farming Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Farming is the foundation of our survival, yet the new generation is
        slowly moving away from it. Lack of awareness, guidance, and modern
        exposure has made agriculture feel outdated and risky.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goal is to bring clarity, purpose, and confidence back to farming by
        showing that agriculture can be smart, sustainable, and future-ready.
