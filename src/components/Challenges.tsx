      <h2>Challenges in Modern Farming</h2>

      <p>
        Farming today is no longer simple. Rising costs, chemical dependency,
        and lack of proper guidance have made agriculture risky and stressful,
        especially for small and young farmers.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Heavy dependence on chemical fertilizers and pesticides</li>
        <li>Soil health degradation and reduced long-term productivity</li>
        <li>Unpredictable climate and weather conditions</li>
        <li>Lack of clear knowledge about sustainable and organic practices</li>
        <li>Limited access to trusted markets and fair pricing</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="highlight">
        These challenges are pushing many away from farming — but with the right
        knowledge and a shift towards organic and sustainable methods, farming
        can regain stability and purpose.
