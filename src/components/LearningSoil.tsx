      <h2>Soil Understanding</h2>

      <p>
        Soil is the foundation of farming. Healthy soil supports strong crops,
        retains water, and provides essential nutrients.
      </p>

      <p>
        Different soils behave differently. Knowing your soil helps you choose
        the right crops and farming methods.
      </p>

      <h4>Main soil properties:</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Texture:</strong> Sandy, clayey, or loamy — affects water
          holding and root growth
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Fertility:</strong> Natural nutrient availability
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Drainage:</strong> How water moves through the soil
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Organic matter:</strong> Improves soil life and structure
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        You don’t need a lab test to start. Even basic observation of color,
        hardness, and water retention gives useful information.
