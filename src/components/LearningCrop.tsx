      <h2>Crop Selection</h2>

      <p>
        Choosing the right crop is one of the most important farming decisions.
        A wrong crop choice can lead to losses even if all other steps are done
        correctly.
      </p>

      <p>
        Crop selection depends on multiple factors working together — not on
        trends or guesswork.
      </p>

      <h4>Key factors for crop selection:</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Climate:</strong> Temperature, rainfall, and humidity
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Soil type:</strong> Nutrient capacity and drainage
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Season:</strong> Kharif, Rabi, or Zaid
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Water availability:</strong> Rain-fed or irrigated
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Market demand:</strong> Local selling potential
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Successful farmers select crops that match their land conditions —
        instead of forcing unsuitable crops with extra chemicals or water.
      </p>

        In the next steps, you will learn how to match crops with your specific
        location and soil.
